# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-from-Scratch
Convolutional Neural Networks from Scratch that I built from the relevant papers.

**Deep CNNt**
I built this as my first ever scratch CNN. I used it as a learning tool to understand CNNs as a whole based on the original paper. I modified the original code and added more layers for higher accuracy
Model was trained on Dental Panoramic Images

**ResNet-50**
I used the pretained ResNet-50 model to learn about Transfer Learning.
Using this model on a Skin Cancer dataset achieved wonderfully accurate classification result

**U-Net**
Model used for segmentation alongside Deep CNN. My idea was to create masks of dental panoramic images to create a focus point for the DCNN.
